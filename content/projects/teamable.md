# Back Story

My main goal was to learn and grow as a developer. Developing a web application using Agile Scrum allowed me to gain hands-on experience with industry-standard development methodologies, making the learning process more structured and effective. The idea of creating an application to manage employees resonated with me as it had real-world significance. Employee management is a crucial aspect of any company's operations, and by building this tool, I saw the potential to make a positive impact on businesses and their employees.
I was keen on understanding how Agile Scrum worked in practice. By using this methodology for the project, I aimed to experience its benefits first-hand, such as improved collaboration, adaptability to changing requirements, and the incremental delivery of features.

In addition to the before mentioned reasons, another significant motivation behind undertaking this project was the desire to gain a comprehensive understanding of the various roles within an IT team. By taking on the responsibilities of the product owner, software developer, tester, and systems administrator, I gained the ability to pivot seamlessly between tasks, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and optimize the development process.

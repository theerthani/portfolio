# Introduction

To understand the Agile Methodology, lets first understand the Software Development Lifecycle(SDLC). In this blog we're gonna learn about all the roles in IT team, responsibilities of these roles. 
How projects were developed before and after agile.
Know the Online Tools for implementing Scrum in our project

# What are Software Development Workflows

In a project team, we don't only have Software developers, we also have other roles which are equally important in the development process. Here are the brief tasks and responsibilities of all the roles in a project team.

1. In a project team, the Product owner identifies the product requirements by talking to the customer and Translates these        requirements into tasks for the development team.
2. Next comes the Software Developer who program the application.
3. Tester tests the application extensively.
4. Finally Systems Administrator creates and configure server, runs the application on it and make it accessible to the users.They also manage and administer database, configure networking for servers.

The most important thing in Software development is collaboration. Though all the roles in a project team has different tasks and responsibilities all the tasks are connected. Product Owner needs to explain the product details to software developers in detail, otherwise the developers end up developing the product which is completely different from what the customer wants.Developers need to communicate with testers when they are done coding the feature, and tester needs to communicate to the developer regarding the bugs that they've found in testing process so the developers can fix those issues. Developer need to tell the systems administrator what the software needs, to run on the server.
Since there are multiple developers, testers and sys admins, they need to communicate with each other. so collaboration is important.

There are some online tools for collaboration between the team members which helps in following: 

1. Documents the whole interactions between the team memebers
2. Other team members know about the decisions etc
3. Be able to group chat
4. Has a nice visualization overview of what features are being developed, what features are tested, and which feature/fix was released.

WHO DEFINES THE WORKFLOW?

When are the features tested? In Bulk, immediately?
Does every feature/bugfix get immediately released?
Does the product owner define the complete features of the software before coding is started?
How often is a new application version released?

Who decides these? who decides how the team works, how often and how fast they develop tasks?
Does each company has its own way of managing projects?

Well actually there is a popular and widely adopted way to manage software projects called Agile Methodology and its specific implementation called Scrum. Agile is a philosophy with core set of values or principles basically on the abstract level on how IT teams should develop the software. And we have Scrum framework that implements this philosophy and defines how this agile concepts should be implemented.
Another such important framework is Kanban. But for now we are just gonna focus on the Scrum framework.

The scrum framework answers all the above questions. It defines how the team should work, with a set of roles, responsibilities and meetings. Each company doesnt have to come up with different frameworks instead they can just use already existing and widely accepted framework like scrum which is industry standard.

# Waterfall vs Agile

The one thing that influences speed and process of software development inside an organization is the methodology or the way an organization is developing applications.
Traditionally there was a methodology called waterfall method. 
How the waterfall works is:
1. First we gather all the requirements and plan everything beforehand related to every specific feature and is listed and documented. 
2. And the development team would take this documentation and starts developing one feature at a time.
3. Once the development part of the application was done, the code then goes to the testing team, where they test each and every feature that was developed. They send the bugs again to the developer and the developer goes through each bug detail and fix it.
4. Now after numerous cycles of testing and fixing the bugs now the product is sent to the operations team where the infrastructure is prepared to deploy the application.

After all these steps it would take massive amount of time since it is very long and ineffective process. Considering very complex applications where features evolve all the time based on new demands from the customer. Companies realised that this methodology lead to failure and miscommunication in many places, and there was no fast feedback. To overcome this Agile methodology was developed.

# Benefits of Agile

The main benefit of Agile is the speed of development, testing and deploying cycles. Basically instead of waiting there to develop the project start to finish by checking off each feature and bug fix and so on.. here each feature gets tested and deployed and there is an immediate feedback if there is some bug in the feature or if the deployment doesnt work etc...
Agile methodology allows fast and flexible development and deployment process

And since Agile is just a methodology which tells what are the good practices that are needed to be followed. It has specific implementations called Scrum and Kanban. Depending upon the needs of the company they may choose any of the framework.

# What is Agile Exactly?

Agile is a practice that develops the application with continuous, short iterations(and several phases). So it breaks down the whole application into smaller chunks. And small chunks can be developed, tested and validated by the customer. 
It is easier, faster and cheaper to make adjustements while development.
It allows lots of flexibility in development process.
In Agile methodology development, testing, and deployment all happen in parallel.
Agile also encourages lot of teamwork and collaboration not only within the team but outside as well like the customers who actually wanted the application, as well as the developers, and the business decision makers in the company must all work together to develop a product.
So, In Agile we are developing products in small, but consumable increments which are needless to say flexible, where requirements, plans and results are evaluated continuously.
It Enables the team to respond to customer's feedback quickly

# What is Scrum?

Scrum is one of the implementations of agile methodology in which those incremental bills are delivered to the customer in every two or three weeks time.

We can also think of Scrum as a project management system that delivers software in small increments in two or three week cycles, also called sprints. And the goal of the sprints is to build the most important features first. More features are added to the application in the next sprints and the already implemented features are adjusted based on the customer feedback from the previous sprints.
Since we cant build the whole application in one sprint we need to plan what features needs to be developed, what bugs needs to be fixed, what changes or adjustments to existing features need to be made.
So the list gets prioritized before each sprint, to decide on the most important tasks to be done.
And the list of tasks that the team prioritizes after each sprint is called a backlog. so that's basically all the tasks, fixes, adjustments etc...
And since in Agile Scrum framework the development is flexible, Based on the customer feedback the features and requirements may change often which means the backlog respectively gets reviewed for any irrelevant tasks, new requirements, adjustments on existing tasks.

Within the Scrum itself there are 3 core roles, which are Scrum Master, Product Owner and Scrum Team and all these people are committed to this scrum project.
The scrum master is someone that makes sure that scrum is done properly by the team. Also in guiding and faciliting support for everyone in the scrum team like helping the product owner define product requirements, identifies impediments/blockers and helps the team in removing them. Scrum Master is also responsible for improving interactions, within the team and the customer.
And the way that Scrum Master identifies these issues is through scrum meetings, Scrum Master is also responsible for holding daily meetings, which are very short that's why also called daily stand-up. The objective of the daily meetings is : Evaluating the progress, Synchronizing activities and identifying impediments.

Then we have Product Owner who represents the customer's interests, acts as intermediatery between the scrum team and the customer. Defines how the product should look like. How it should function. What features is should have. And these are the ones who add the tasks to the backlog, and does regular adjustments, prioritizes tasks on a regular basis.

Finally we have Scrum team, which is a self-organized team with people from different backgrounds such as programmers, testers, designers, sys admins etc. They do the actual work of implementing the tasks of the sprint and produce deliverable products. They shares responsibilities for meeting the sprints goal. The teams are self-manages: can manage decisions to get work done.

And Finally in Scrum we have secondary roles, which are everyone else like management in the company, people form the customer side, members of the executive team etc. who are not directly involved in the team but they in someway contribute to project from outside.

# Online Tools from Scrum

One of the most widely used tool is Jira which manages agile projects. This tool enables agile workflows, like scrum. Jira has features that let's us use scrum in our project. It has backlog of tasks that needs to be implemented, as well as create sprints for our team. we have a scrum board where tasks are planned, which ones are in progress, done and completed and who is working on what.

Together, Agile Scrum and Jira form a symbiotic relationship that empowers teams to optimize productivity, enhance communication, and ultimately deliver exceptional software products. Embracing these methodologies and tools not only leads to successful project outcomes but also nurtures a culture of collaboration, innovation, and continuous growth within the development teams.

Thats it for this one folks...

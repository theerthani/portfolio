# What are JS Frameworks and why they are useful?
 
 When you heard the word JS frameworks, you might be wondering What is a JavaScript framework exactly? Why do we need it? Why cant we use JavaScript. Basically we use Javascript to access the elements, to add new elements to the html structure and so on. But it was on a very low level, meaning we have to use the document object and go through the whole structure and find the id, or so on.. we have to remember the id making it very inefficient. When we are developing any complex project, it would be difficult and much work to bild complex UI. Code will become complex, repetitive and hard to maintain.

Various developers developed programs using vanilla JS itself that make working with javascript easier. They developed concepts and rules for structuring JS code.  
It makes easier to manage to code. The program abstracts away the complexity e.g. for working with HTML. We can use these programs to write your application more easily and faster. And these programs are JS frameworks, they give us a framework(concepts, rules and ready-made components or solutions) for writing JS applications. Overtime many frameworks have been developed but few of them has become most popular
